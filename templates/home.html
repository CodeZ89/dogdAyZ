        PetBook: A Centralized Rescue Database for Underserved Shelters Across the US

        PetBook is a centralized database where a user may find animals that are available for adoption across the
        United States. In 2021, PetBook assisted in the rehoming of more than 2000 pets to approximately 1500 families,
        from hard to reach shelters across the country. PetBook also assists these shelters with finding eligible foster
        parents for animals that are unable to be housed at the shelter's home location. Currently PetBook works with
        over 100 shelters and 250 active foster homes across the US. PetBook uses a matchmaking algorithm to match pets
        to potential adopters, and adopters to potential pets. A database driven website that will record and facilitate
        the adoption of Pets that are available across the country in Shelters and Fosters (foster homes), and keep
        record of the families/people that may want to become Adopters.
